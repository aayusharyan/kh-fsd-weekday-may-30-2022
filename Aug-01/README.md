## How to add CSS to your React App.
- External
- By adding an external stylesheet and writing the Style in that Stylesheet.

- Inline / Internal
- Writing the CSS style inside the component itself.
- The Style Properties change their casing from kebab-case to camelCase. Values are in string data type, therefore, wrapped inside quotation marks.

## Create a Project, inside that 1 component containing 2 h2, first h2 will be yellow background, red text. Second h2 will be red background, yellow text.

## Ternary operator
Usage: <condition> ? <true_value> : <false_value>
//Check for even number

( number % 2 == 0 ) ? "Even Number" : "Odd Number";

// const isEven = num => num % 2 == 0 ? "Even Number" : "Odd Number";

### Task A - Light and Dark theme.

## Conditional Rendering
- Usage of ternary operators to show/hide a component.
- This typically depends on the value of a state which can be toggled.
- That can be done by using a function.

# Task:
- Create a Task List.
- You have an input type text.
- You have a button type submit.
- You have a ul.
- When I type a task and click add button, it should be added to my list.
- Hint -> You will be using state and onClick and value attribute, Array and Array.push.
