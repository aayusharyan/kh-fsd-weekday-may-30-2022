## NodeJS
- It is a tool (software) which allows usage of JS outside the browser.
- It's like an environment inside where we can execute JavaScript.
- JS is a multi purpose language.
- JS can be used as a server, it can also be used to perform some execution.

## create-react-app
- Script which someone has written.
- It is written in JS.
- When we execute this script, it will prepare the boilerplate (the directory structure and the default files inside it).
- These things are called packages.
- There are thousands of packages available.

## Node Package Manager
- This is built into with node and the idea is to help manage packages.
- We can install something, uninstall something, etc. etc.
- https://www.npmjs.com/

## npx (Node Package Executor)
- The purpose of this is to execute the packages.
- Example:

npx create-react-app <app/project_name>
> npx create-react-app hello_world


## To start the nodeJS Server.
- Instead of running the live server, we use this.
- npm start


- Ways in which we can run JS outside the browser.
1. NodeJS
2. DenoJS
3. BunJS


## Bundler
- Webpack
- Used


## functional components
- For each component, we use a function instead of a class.
- This makes things easy.
- No need of extending, no need of importing React.
- No need of render method, just have a function, put logic inside it and then return the JSX.
- const function = () => {}... Then, export default function...
- To get the props, we can directly use the parameters.
- It is more recommended.


## Prop Drilling
- Passing of props from an ancestor component to a descendant component.
- The data is not consumed by the immediate child, but instead it is sent to child of child.
