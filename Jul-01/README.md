## Conversion of Data type from String to Number
- parseInt   -> Convert from string to number (integer).
- parseFloat -> Convert from string to number (decimal).


### Tasks:
- Create 4 buttons and 4 functions (1 for each).

Task 2 - Take input from the user as a string and print the character that is most occured. (For example, from the Input ABCDAAA, the output will be A)/

Task 3 - Take input fromm the user, convert it to a number and print the factorial of that number (For example, factorial of 5 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120, print 120).

Task 4 - Take input from the user as a string and print the number of characters of that string (excluding the vowels, For, example -> "Aayush" , output 3, "Unnati" -> 3).
