# Responsiveness 
- The ability of any website to maintain the design asthetics (good looks) for multiple viewport dimensions.

- If the website looks good on all the various viewport dimensions, I say that the website is Responsive, otherwise, I say it is not responsive.

Flex gives responsiveness and allows change of structure.


display: flex
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap;

max-width
gap
justify-content


Justify content is applied on the main axis
Align items is applied on the cross axis.

Main axis is basically the flex direction.


# Task
- Create an array of 30 images. (Any image you can pick).
["<url>", "<url>", "<url>"];
- Use DOM manipulation to create the gallery.
- Use flex as Style to make it responsive.
