### Terminal
-> It allows us to interact with the computer.
-> GUI -> Graphical User Interface
-> CLI -> Command Line Interface
-> In terminal, we type commands and we get the response.


-> Format of terminal is
username@machine

### whoami
--> It gives out the user name.

### Directory Structure. (Folder).
--> It's like a collection of files.
--> Folders can be nested.
--> In WINDOWS, we reach the Drives (C:, D:, E:, F:). That is the ROOT of everything.
--> In technical terms, we don't say Folders, we can directory. (Directories)
--> It can be nested.
--> In LINUX, root is referred as `/`
--> In LINUX, home is referred as `~`


### ls
--> This is a list command, this will list whatever we have inside our directory.


### Directory Navigation (cd)
--> cd stands for change directory
--> Using cd is cd<space><directory_name>
--> `cd ..` will take me to parent directory.


--> Task for you:
--> Open the terminal, keep doing `cd ..` till you reach the root, then perform ls and share screenshot of what you see.
