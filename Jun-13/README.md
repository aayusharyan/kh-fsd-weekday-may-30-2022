**GIT IS NOT SAME AS GITHUB**

## Git
--> It is a software.
--> The purpose of git is for Version Control.

--> What is Version of a Software.
---> Any software has versions.
---> The idea is to keep a track.
---> Because, in future, we might want to update that. (Maybe new Technology, Maybe new functionality, maybe new Programming Language).
---> Any software that we write, we will constantly keep on updating.


## Repository (repo)
---> This is like the main folder of your project.
---> Everything will be inside this folder.
---> It can have as many folders inside it as possible.
---> No part of your project can be outside of your repository.


Version Control System (VCS)
--> git

--> git init
--> git add
--> git remote
--> git commit
--> git push




--> git
