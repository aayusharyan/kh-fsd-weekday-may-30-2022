- HTML
- We write code which will be shown in the web browser.
- Any website, is created using HTML, CSS or JS.
- HTML gives the structure.
- CSS gives the looks and design.
- JS gives the functionality.


# HTML
--> Hypertext Markup Language
--> It is used to organize/strcture the contents of any page.
--> This is specifically for browsers.

# Markup language
--> It is used to organize the contents.
--> Examples, HTML, XML, LATEX, MD etc. etc.

Note: Markup Languages are NOT Programming Languages.
--> In any programming language, we can execute Algorithm. In HTML (or any other markup language), we cannot.

> Syntaxt -> It is a set of rules that we need to follow (as a programmer).

> Tags -> Whatever content you write, should be written within the tags.
--> A tag looks like some text within <>.
--> Opening tags are represented <tag_name>.
--> Closing tags are represented </tag_name>.

In HTML, it is possible to do nesting of tags.
That means, we can have 1 tag inside another tag. (It can be any tag).
