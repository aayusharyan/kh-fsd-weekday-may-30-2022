## lang attribute
- Used to tell the language of the content that we are showing.
- If we have multi-lang page, then each element can have lang attribute.

### Webpage vs Website
- A webpage is a SINGLE html page.
- A website is a collection of pages.
- A single page is called webpage, a collection is called website.

### Input type checkbox
- Allows us to select multiple things.
- Also allows to uncheck.

### Input type radio
- Can select ONLY 1 item.
- Once selected, cannot unselect (we need to reset the form)

### name attribute
- Used to give identification to the data.
- Used to organize the data when sending to the backend.

### value attribute
- For checkbox and radio, option it's important to give.
- For other inputs, it's like giving default value.

### required attribute
- It makes that input mandatory to fill.

### form tag
- Used to bundle multiple inputs.  (even 1 input is ok.)
- Forms have action which represent what to do when the form is submitted.

### input type reset
- Resets the form to it's default state.

### textarea tag
- Allows multi line input.
- Textarea cares about the spacing and new lines.

### b (bold) / strong
- Makes the text bold
- Prefer strong tag.

### i (italic) / em
- Makes the text Italic.
- Prefer the em tag. em means emphasis.

### u
- Makes underline for the text.
- Prefer NOT to use it. We will do this same thing using CSS.
