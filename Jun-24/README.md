1. Designing the Google Page


## HTML entities
- These are special codes that we can use and give special characters in the HTML.
- Syntax of entity:
- &<entity_code>;
- Example:
- &lt; -> `<`
- &gt; -> `>`
- &nbsp; -> ` `
- &copy; -> `©`
- &reg; -> `®`
- &quot; -> `"`
- &amp; -> `&`

## Box Model:
- Every element in HTML is made up of a box.
- The box contains: content, padding, border, margin.

## Padding:
- This is the space that we can give inside the content;
- This space is within the border.
- We can change padding for each side individually.

## Margijn
- This is the space that we give outside of the content.
- This will shift other elements as well.
- We can change margin for each side individually.

## display property
- display: none -> Don't display the element AT ALL!
- display: inline -> Show in the same line, consume width of only the content.
- display: block -> Take the whole block of line. Take all avialble width by default. Move other items to the next line.
- display: inline-block - This is a middle ground for inline and block. This allows us to set width (that block ✔️, inline ❌) and allows the content to be on the same line. (block ❌, inline ✔️)

Setting Custom size, Showing other in the same line.
block (✔️, ❌)
inline (❌, ✔️)
inline-block (✔️, ✔️)

## Position
- This defines the position of any element.
- position: relative -> Move the element RELATIVE to the initial position.

## Pixel
- This is the smallest dot, any screen an control.
- Typically it is a square made up of RG and B LEDs.
